# NumPDE
Lecture material used in my 8 hour long PhD course on "Numerical Methods for Partial Differential Equations" at the [PhD School in Physics and Astronomy](https://www.fisica.unimib.it/en/teaching/phdcourse) of the University of Milano-Bicocca. The lectures were held between April and May 2025.

This repository contains three python notebooks to very briefly introduce students to the use of finite difference methods in the solution of hyperbolic, parabolic, and elliptic partial differential equations.

I suggest to use the notebooks in the following order:
1. Hyperbolic_PDE.ipynb
2. Parabolic_PDE.ipynb
3. Elliptic_PDE.ipynb

Comments and suggestions are welcome
